- `index.html` – Form structure with input fields
- `style.css` – Basic styling and layout
- `script.js` – Validation logic and DOM handling

## 🎯 Validation Rules

| Field            | Validation Rule                                    |

## 📚 What I Learned

- DOM selection and manipulation
- Writing custom JavaScript validation logic
- Regular expressions for pattern matching
- Creating responsive and user-friendly UI
- Structuring form code for reusability
